## Objectives

This second workshop seeks to continue the development of a community of practice dedicated to understanding change in marine biodiversity and generating knowledge and products that inform conservation and management strategies of marine living resources by engaging researchers, managers and policy-makers with interest in biodiversity monitoring and data synthesis and analysis. During this workshop participants will:

1. Advance already agreed field sampling protocols for rocky shores and sandy beaches;
1. Manipulate tabular and spatial data already collected at their study sites for standardized data formats using Darwin Core vocabularies and quality controls;
1. Develop specific vocabularies for flora and fauna of rocky shore and sandy beach measured during field surveys;
1. Publish survey datasets to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System ([OBIS](http://www.iobis.org/)) using tools for sharing data;
1. Advance knowledge on data science tools (R, Rmarkdown, Github) to mine data, visualize and analysis, and produce reproducible research documents with interactive visualizations onto the web.

## Workshop rationale

The **MBON Pole to Pole** is organizing a second Marine Biodiversity Workshop - From the Sea to the Cloud - after a successful first workshop held during the 2018 AmeriGEOSS Week in Brazil. This activity advances the implementation of the MBON Pole to Pole network by enhancing knowledge on field data collection methods and use of informatic technologies for data management and analysis. 

The MBON Pole to Pole aims to address the biodiversity priorities of various GEO initiatives, including Blue Planet and AmeriGEOSS, and coordinates with the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO and OBIS, and other national and international groups to serve the broadest possible community. This network will help nations and regions to improve conservation planning and environmental impact mitigation, serve the scientific community, and satisfy commitments to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), Aichi Targets of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s).

The MBON Pole to Pole workshops:

- enhance coordination of data collection among nations;
- improve the collection of harmonized data, developing data standards and methodologies for data management and dissemination without compromising national concerns;
- support the integration of biodiversity information with physical and chemical data over time (status and trends); and
- generates products needed for informed policy and management of the ocean.

The workshop targets investigators and resource managers dedicated to studying and conserving biodiversity of invertebrates in two important coastal habitats: rocky shore intertidal zone and sandy beaches. This activity targets participants from all nations in the Americas, from pole to pole.

## Eligibility

The workshop will be limited to 20 participants. Selection of participants will be based on results from the Application Survey (below) and their ability and willingness to openly share data through OBIS, sustain a collaborative long-term monitoring program in their study area, share best practices and contribute to achieving the overall goals of the MBON Pole to Pole. Priority will be given to participants of the previous workshop that conducted biodiversity surveys at their study sites as agreed during this activity and that have submitted data sheets to the MBON Pole to Pole Github repository. Applicants willing to use and share their own data are also eligible if specific information about their dataset is provided, study site(s) location(s), time span of their dataset and methods employed.
